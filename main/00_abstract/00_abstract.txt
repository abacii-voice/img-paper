Accurate cell segmentation is crucial to biological and medical studies in providing representative data of cell movements and shapes to judge the effects of drugs and other environmental changes. Current methods rely on outlining the cell projected in 2D or a volumetric approximation based on 3D data. A common imaging method is confocal microscopy, where the images stored capture a range of focal planes in an environment. This provides 3D data and the ability to move an object of interest in and out of focus after the images have been captured, potentially offering accurate segmentation. However, conventional segmentation software fails to fully exploit the 3D nature of the data and is unable to make complex associations between image channels.

Here we describe a method for selecting regions of the brightfield channel that contain clear edges suitable for segmentation by determining the XYZ coordinates of bright regions in the GFP. This exploits the relationship between the coordinate systems of the image sets, since the majority of the 3D set of brightfield images is blurred and unsuitable for segmentation. Images of the environment can thus be simplified into a 2D projection that can be readily processed by CellProfiler or ImageJ. This method has been tested on breast cancer cells in a PDMS micro-fluidics environment and yields clear segmentation. This is an improvement over previous 2D methods of image pre-processing, which are unable to extract usable information from the 3D environment.
