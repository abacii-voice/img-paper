1. Coordinate systems

Images were grouped according to frame and channel. Images of the same frame and the same channel could be organised into a 3D block of pixels with X, Y and Z coordinates. 3D smoothing and noise-reduction could then be applied to this structure. Each column of pixels, or a single line of pixels with a fixed XY coordinate and the full range of Z coordinates, could be used to build up an intensity distribution in Z. This is known in this study as a "profile". The GFP channel provides 3D data since levels can be optically separated from each other. High intensity at a certain Z level indicates the presence of an object at that location in the original environment. Typically, the profile will have a low value when passing through the background, and a high value when passing through an object. This leads to a peak near the centre of an object. The location of the peak in Z and other properties of the distribution can allow pixels from the brightfield that show clear edges to be selected and compiled into a useful image.

2. The GFP profile

Figure [[[fig]]] shows an example of a profile for a single pixel. The profile can be generated using two parameters; namely, the amount of gaussian smoothing applied to the image to reduce noise, [[[sigma]]], and the radius of the size of the column in XY around the position of the profile, [[[r]]]. Both of these parameters can be adjusted to affect the output. A discussion of their optimum ranges in given in Section [[[section]]]. They both define forms of smoothing. [[[sigma]]] is the radius of the 3D gaussian kernel. [[[r]]] is the radius of a linear smoothing filter in XY, since information from different columns at the same Z can be combined to yield the value of a single Z level for a profile.
