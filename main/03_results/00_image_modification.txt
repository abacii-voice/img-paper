1. List of steps

A graphical layout of the steps taken to modify the images is shown in Figure [[[fig]]]. First, the images are organised by frame and channel. Each frame is loaded as a set of 3D stacks, one for each channel. In this case, only the GFP and the brightfield were used. The GFP is smoothed to reduce noise. A new image, [[[zMod]]], stores the Z position of the point of maximum intensity for each profile. This is analogous to a terrain showing the height of each point in the environment. A new brightfield image, [[[zBF]]], is then created by selecting brightfield pixel values from the 3D stack whose Z position is indicated by the value stored in [[[zMod]]] at the same XY position. In this manner, brightfield pixels are selected only from the brightest regions of the GFP coordinate system, where the objects containing GFP are in-focus and have clear, visible edges suitable for segmentation. The [[[zBF]]] image can then be segmented using conventional 2D segmentation.

2. Further improvements to segmentation using 3D data

2D segmentation algorithms are unable to take account of 3D information that could inform more accurate segmentation of an object. For example, GFP intensity information can be used to highlight areas of an image that contain cells to prevent the segmentation from extending into the background.
